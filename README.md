# ini-parser
A simple tool I made for my future projects that can parse an INI file to a linked list structure. Still WIP!

## TODO
- Handle spaces between `key` and `=`
- Handle spaces between `=` and `value`
- Add section and keyValue counting
  - IniSection IniFile structs contain a count field that is not currently used
- Clean up `ParseFile()` function
